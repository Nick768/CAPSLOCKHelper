# CAPSLOCKHelper
ARE YOU ANNOYED OF ACCIDENTALLY PRESSING CAPSLOCK? IF YES, HERE IS YOUR SOLUTION:
### CAPSLOCKHelper

This small script prevents you from accidentally pressing CAPSLOCK. It adds a timer (you have to hold capslock for ~1 second) and a small (not really; you will see it :-)) overlay to show if CAPSLOCK is activated.

## How to use?
1. Install AutoHotkey V2 or compile this script with [this](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe) tool
2. Place the .ahk script (if you compiled it, then copy the .exe file) in your startup folder (Press Win + R and type "shell:startup" without quotes)
3. Double click the script/.exe to start it
4. Now press your CAPSLOCK key and look what happens...

### Note:
You can also download a compiled version [here](https://github.com/Nick768/CAPSLOCKHelper/releases/latest) (click on the CAPSLOCKHelper.exe to download it). Then follow the How to use section from the second step (copy the downloaded .exe instead of the .ahk script)

## How to uninstall?
Just delete the script/executable from your startup folder
