# CAPSLOCKHelper
This small script prevents you from accidentally pressing CAPSLOCK. It adds a timer (you have to hold capslock for ~1-2 seconds) and a small overlay to show if CAPSLOCK is activated.

## How to use?
* Install AutoHotkey V2 or compile this script with [this](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe) tool
* Place it (if you compiled it, then copy the .exe file) in your startup folder (Press Win + R and type "shell:startup" without quotes)
* Double click the script/.exe to start it
* Now press your CAPSLOCK key and look what happens...

## How to uninstall?
Just delete te script/executable from your startup folder
